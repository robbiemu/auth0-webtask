This webtask hack gets a random image from the deviantArt API , by default a random overwatch-related trending image. It accepts params to pass on to the API, so you can change that, however, it must use the RSS endpoint.

Since the url to the iamge doesnt change, but the image does every time you hit it, ti could be used to fetch an image to cycle through as the webcache expires on a web page, or a similar affair.
